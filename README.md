# Example Prefab Micronaut Application

This repo shows how to add [Prefab] to your Rails app to get access to features like

- Dynamic log levels
- Feature flags
- Live config

Follow along on YouTube (coming soon)

## Micronaut Launch

The [first commit](https://github.com/prefab-cloud/example-micronaut-app/commit/d915d4d83b8c9e6de9105d3c66dde85b391aa413) was built using [Micronaut Launch], an online wrapper of the micronaut CLI  

## Initial Content

Before adding Prefab to the project, We'll add a very basic one page site that will allow logging in as various users. Nothing Prefab specific here, so just a quick overview.

* [ExampleAuthenticationProvider](https://github.com/prefab-cloud/example-micronaut-app/blob/initial-content/src/main/java/com/example/auth/ExampleAuthenticationProvider.java) Implements username only login process and a rudimentary database of fake users and one real user, our CEO, Jeff
* [DefaultLoginFilter](https://github.com/prefab-cloud/example-micronaut-app/blob/initial-content/src/main/java/com/example/auth/DefaultLoginFilter.java) Runs after the authentication process to ensure that Jeff is logged if no one else is. Has some logging we'll use to demonstrate dynamic log levels later.
* [HomeController](https://github.com/prefab-cloud/example-micronaut-app/blob/initial-content/src/main/java/com/example/HomeController.java) to build out a template that will be rendered by our handlebars view
* [Home View](https://github.com/prefab-cloud/example-micronaut-app/blob/initial-content/src/main/resources/views/home.hbs) to render our home page with its library of users to log in as.
* Adds stock images for our fake users.

Now you can start the app with `MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS=development ./mvnw mn:run`

## Install Prefab

[Full diff](https://github.com/prefab-cloud/example-micronaut-app/compare/initial-content...install-prefab)
### Dependencies

First we need to add maven dependencies for Prefab by adding a property to control the version

```xml
<prefab.version>0.3.8pre4</prefab.version>
```
Then our dependencies
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>cloud.prefab</groupId>
    <artifactId>client</artifactId>
    <version>${prefab.version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>cloud.prefab</groupId>
    <artifactId>logback-listener</artifactId>
    <version>${prefab.version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>cloud.prefab</groupId>
    <artifactId>micronaut</artifactId>
    <version>${prefab.version}</version>
 </dependency>
```

### Dependency Injection

We'll next write a factory class to handle initializing instances of the prefab clients and making them available for injection as-needed.

[PrefabFactory](https://github.com/prefab-cloud/example-micronaut-app/blob/install-prefab/src/main/java/com/example/config/PrefabFactory.java) looks like this

```java
@Factory
public class PrefabFactory {
  private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(PrefabFactory.class);

  @Singleton
  public PrefabCloudClient prefabCloudClient(Environment environment) {
    final Options options = new Options();
    LOG.info("Prefab Envs {}", environment.getActiveNames().stream().toList());
    options.setPrefabEnvs(environment.getActiveNames().stream().toList());
    return new PrefabCloudClient(options);
  }

  @Singleton
  public FeatureFlagClient featureFlagClient(PrefabCloudClient prefabCloudClient) {
    return prefabCloudClient.featureFlagClient();
  }

  @Context
  public ConfigClient configClient(
    PrefabCloudClient prefabCloudClient
  ) {
    ConfigClient configClient = prefabCloudClient.configClient();
    // install the logging filter at the same time
    PrefabMDCTurboFilter.install(configClient);
    return configClient;
  }
}
```

The `prefabCloudClient` method creates a Prefab Options object and instantiates a PrefabCloudClient with those options

The `@Context` annotation eagerly instantiates the `ConfigClient`, which requires instantiating `PrefabCloudClient`. The `configClient` method also wires up the `PrefabMDCTurboFilter` which will manage log output for us, as we'll see later.

### Get a Prefab API Key
The last part of adding Prefab to your app is to get an API key from https://app.prefab.cloud and set it as the environment variable PREFAB_API_KEY. We'll restart our app to make sure it uses that env var.

That's all it takes to add Prefab to your app. Now let's take some of the features for a test drive.

## Dynamic log levels

No work needed here, the HomeController already has some log lines in it - as a reminder those are

```java
LOG.debug("üîç Hello debug logger");
LOG.info("‚ÑπÔ∏è Hello info logger");
LOG.warn("‚ö†Ô∏è Hello warn logger");
LOG.error("üö® Hello error logger");
```

The default log level in the [logback.xml](https://github.com/prefab-cloud/example-micronaut-app/blob/install-prefab/src/main/resources/logback.xml) file is INFO. When we visit http://localhost:8080 we should see the ERROR, WARN and INFO output but not the DEBUG.

In the Prefab UI, let's set our "Root Log Level" to "WARN". Now reloading http://localhost:8080 shows the ERROR, WARN output. Note how the output changes.

Prefab lets you change log levels on the fly. We can even set log levels for specific for specific packages and classes by fully qualified class name. 

Once your app has been running for about a minute it will have phoned-home stats about the logging output to prefil the log-level UI in prefab.

## Configure Prefab Contexts for targeted Log Levels

We can get even more specific about when to log by providing the Prefab client with more contextual information about what your app is doing for whom. Let's check it out.

[Full diff](https://github.com/prefab-cloud/example-micronaut-app/compare/install-prefab...configure-prefab-context)

First we add one line to the PrefabFactory we previously set up `options.setContextStore(new ServerRequestContextStore());`. Our default ContextStore is based on thread locals, but that doesn't work for event-based systems like micronaut. The `ServerRequestContextStore` is stashed as an attribute in the HttpRequest, and we let Micronaut's thread instrumentation handle the thread local that backs `ServerRequestContext`

Next we add a [filter](https://github.com/prefab-cloud/example-micronaut-app/blob/configure-prefab-context/src/main/java/com/example/prefab/PrefabContextFilter.java) to add a prefab context based on the currently "logged in' user.

```java
  configClient.getContextStore()
        .addContext(PrefabContext.newBuilder("user")
            .put("id", user.id())
            .put("country", user.country())
            .put("email", user.email())
            .build()
        );
```

Lets restart the app and try it out! 

Now imagine Jeff has reported a problem, so lets see how we can get more logs for him. Let's go back to the log configuration in Prefab add a targetted option for user id on the HomeController log levels at debug for id=1, and set warn as the default. Reload the page as Jeff and we can see all the logs, but for anyone else the logs are much quieter.

## Feature Flags

[Full diff](https://github.com/prefab-cloud/example-micronaut-app/compare/configure-prefab-context...add-feature-flag)

Let's use the information we put in the context to disable the cookie banner for some users. Lets create a feature flag called "gdpr.banner" with a default value of true then use it in our application.

After we inject `FeatureFlagClient` into the `HomeController` we can evaluate the flag and place the result into the template like this.

```java
templateData.put("showGdprBanner", featureFlagClient.featureIsOn("gdpr.banner"));
```

Note that we don't pass a context in, because we've already set a request-scoped property containing the user data.

in the template we'll wrap the banner in a block like this 
```
{{#if showGdprBanner }}
[the banner]
{{/if}}
```

Restart the app and we can see the banner is still there. Now we'll update the feature flag's rules to evaluate to false for users with "country' equal to "US" . Logging in as Jeff and the banner is gone, logging in as someone else and the banner is back.


## All the Configs

[Full diff](https://github.com/prefab-cloud/example-micronaut-app/compare/add-feature-flag...show-values-table)

The final stop on our tour is to add a table showing all of the available configurations with the default, non-targetted values plus the value evaluated with the current user context.

We'll be showing both the default, non-targeted values and the context-targetted values. ConfigClient's getAll method will return us a map of all keys and values but they'll be targetted values.

To work around that we'll use a context helper to temporarily blank out the global context like this

```java
 try (PrefabContextHelper.PrefabContextScope ignored = new PrefabContextHelper(configClient).performWorkWithAutoClosingContext(PrefabContextSetReadable.EMPTY)) {
            templateData.put("allConfigs", configClient.getAll(PrefabContextSetReadable.EMPTY));
      }
```

We could call getAll again without the wrapper to get the targetted values, but instead we'll create a handlebars helper (see [HandlebarsFactory](https://github.com/prefab-cloud/example-micronaut-app/blob/show-values-table/src/main/java/com/example/config/HandlebarsFactory.java)) to evaluate a config key. It'll look like this

```java
 handlebars.registerHelper("prefabEvaluateAndCoerceToString",
                (Helper<String>) (key, options) -> new Handlebars.SafeString(configClient.get(key).flatMap(ConfigValueUtils::coerceToString).orElse(""))
        );
```

when we call that in the template, that'll evaluate using the request scoped context to get the context-targeted value. 

The body of the table evaluates like this - the targeted value row passes the config key (the key of that map we set) to the helper like this `{{ prefabEvaluateAndCoerceToString @key }`

```
{{# each allConfigs }}
    <tr class="odd:bg-blue-50">
        <td class="p-4 break-all">{{ @key }}</td>
        <td class="p-4">{{ prefabCoerceToString this }}</td>
        <td class="p-4">{{ prefabEvaluateAndCoerceToString @key }}</td>
        <td class="p-4">{{ this.typeCase }}</td>
    </tr>
{{/each }}
```

Now click around and observe that Jeff's columns for gdpr.banner differ between default and targeted value, while our other users do not.
